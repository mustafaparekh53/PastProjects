# Jardine Executive Training Scheme (JETS) applications' data visualizer

**Project Description:** This portal allows to visualize and analyse the data collected during the 5 rounds of JETS recruitment. The data is visualized in 4 different formats namely **Row charts, Funnel chart, Table,** and **Stacked Bar chart**. And **cross-filtering** is provided amongst all these charts based on **3 dimensions** in the data (Universities, Promotional Channels, and Assessment Centers). Did **[end-to-end development](http://www.rapidsofttechnologies.com/end-to-end-website-development.php)** and devoted approximately 2.5 months to this project.

**My responsibilty:**
* **Project Manager**; collecting user requirements, tasks allocation, progress updates. Supervsied **POC** (Proof Of Concept) and **UAT** (User Acceptance Testing) stages.
* Set up the **Backend** of the application; **web-server** and **server-side** scripts to serve the Frontend and communicate with the APIs using **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** along with the **[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)**.
* Cleaned and organised the Frontend code by applying **Modular structure** to it. 
* Used **[AmCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/), [d3-funnel](https://jakezatecky.github.io/d3-funnel/),** and **[CanvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/)** for different visualizations. And **[DC.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)** for cross-filtering.
* Initially deployed the application on **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)** and then permanently on **[AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)**.

*Please note that due to data privcacy issues, the application is not available and accessible for general public which is why I have attached a short recording (GIF) for demonstration. If you want to have a proper look at the video, please download the **.mp4** video file from above*
